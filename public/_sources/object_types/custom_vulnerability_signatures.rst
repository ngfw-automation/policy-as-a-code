Custom Vulnerability Signatures
===============================

Custom vulnerability signatures allow you to define your own vulnerability signatures for use in vulnerability protection profiles.

File Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom vulnerability signatures are defined in files located in:

.. code-block:: text

   ngfw/objects/custom objects/vulnerability/

This path is defined in the Settings module as ``CUSTOM_VULNERABILITY_SIGNATURES_FOLDER``.

Implementation Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom vulnerability signatures are processed by functions in various modules to create custom vulnerability signature objects using the Palo Alto Networks SDK. These functions:

1. Parse the configuration files for custom vulnerability signatures
2. Create custom vulnerability signature objects with the appropriate settings
3. Deploy the custom vulnerability signatures to the PAN-OS device using multi-config API calls

Custom vulnerability signatures can be used to:

- Define signatures for vulnerabilities that are not included in the predefined vulnerability database
- Create custom protection for specific applications or protocols
- Apply vulnerability protection to custom applications
- Protect against zero-day vulnerabilities before official signatures are available
