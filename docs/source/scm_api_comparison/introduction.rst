Introduction
------------

This report compares the API capabilities of **Palo Alto Networks Strata Cloud Manager (SCM)** with those of
**Panorama (PAN-OS 10.2 / 11.1)**, focusing on managing security and decryption policies via automation.
We examine feature parity between SCM and Panorama, differences in API structure, authentication and access control,
deployment (commit/push) workflows, SDK support, and migration considerations for code portability.
