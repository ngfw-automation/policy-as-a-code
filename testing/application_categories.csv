infrastructure,blocked,N/A,gtp-base,Sanctioned,"GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) is a group of IP-based communications protocols used to carry General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) within GSM and UMTS networks.
GTP can be decomposed into separate protocols, GTP-C, GTP-U and GTP'. GTP-C is used within the GPRS core network for signaling between Gateway GPRS Support Nodes (GGSN) and Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSN). This allows the SGSN to activate a session on a user's behalf (PDP context activation), to deactivate the same session, to adjust quality of service parameters, or to update a session for a subscriber who has just arrived from another SGSN.
GTP-U is used for carrying user data within the GPRS Core Network and between the Radio Access Network and the core network. The user data transported can be packets in any of IPv4, IPv6, or PPP formats.
GTP' (GTP prime) uses the same message structure as GTP-C and GTP-U, but has an independent function. It can be used for carrying charging data from the Charging Data Function (CDF) of the GSM or UMTS network to the Charging Gateway Function (CGF). In most cases, this should mean from many individual network elements such as the GGSNs to a centralized computer that delivers the charging data more conveniently to the network operator's billing center.
Different GTP variants are implemented by RNCs, SGSNs, GGSNs and CGFs within 3GPP networks. GPRS mobile stations (MSs) are connected to a SGSN without being aware of GTP.

Implementations are currently available for Java Platform, Standard Edition, C/C++/C# and J2ME. The C# Version uses the C++/C native bindings and is not a complete re-implementation in its own right. JXTA peers create a virtual overlay network which allows a peer to interact with other peers even when some of the peers and resources are behind firewalls and NATs or use different network transports.

instant-messaging,managed,UG-instant-messaging,mibbit,Sanctioned,"Mibbit is a web-based client for modern web browsers that supports Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Yahoo Messenger, and Twitter. It is developed by Jimmy Moore and is designed around the Ajax model with a user interface written in JavaScript.

Mibbit's user interface operates entirely within a web browser and does not require installation of any software on the user's computer. Most modern web browsers that support recent versions of JavaScript are supported, including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Google Chrome, and Safari. Mobile devices such as the Apple iPhone iPod Touch, and Nokia N800, and other platforms such as the Nintendo Wii are also supported.

Unlike typical web-based IRC clients, Mibbit makes use of a client-server design model. The user interface is written in HTML and JavaScript using Ajax programming techniques. The client's backend is written completely in Java and operates independently of the web server in a standalone fashion on the Mibbit server. This design differs from web browser component clients such as ChatZilla or Java applet based IRC clients such as PJIRC that operate entirely from within the web browser. It also differs from server-based web proxy IRC clients such as CGI:IRC where all processing takes place on a remote server.

Because the client-server design allows for a centralized Mibbit client server, Mibbit is able to offer extended functionality which is not present in the standard IRC protocol. Some of these extensions include a channel chat buffer that can be shown to Mibbit clients when they join a channel where another Mibbit user is already present, a notification for other Mibbit users that you are typing a message to them, and distinctive icons that allow identification of the device used with Mibbit such as an iPhone, iPod Touch, Wii, etc.

Mibbit supports the webirc (cgiirc) protocol which allows the client to send the user's IP address and hostname to the IRC server. Servers that support webirc allow Mibbit users to appear as regular IRC clients instead of appearing to connect from the mibbit.com domain. If webirc is not used or is unavailable, Mibbit puts the user's hostname in the client's realname field and encodes the user's IP address in hexadecimal and sends it as the ident reply.",4,,collaboration,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No

Remote control software allows a user to control another computer across the local network or the Internet, viewing its screen and using its keyboard and mouse as if he or she were sitting in front of it. Timbuktu is compatible with computers running both Mac OS X and Windows.

Timbuktu was first developed in the late 1980s as a Macintosh product by Farallon Computing and a version was later developed to run on Microsoft Windows. Farallon was renamed Netopia in 1999 and the company was acquired by Motorola in February 2007. Timbuktu is currently the only commercial non-VNC-based remote control software which has both a server and client running on both platforms (the open-source Virtual Network Computing protocol also has implementations on both platforms, from separate vendors). Timbuktu's primary function is remote control, and the application has support for various remote-control features such as multiple displays, screen-scaling, remote screen lockout and keyboard lockout, clipboard synchronization and ""on the fly"" color-depth reduction for enhanced speed.

In addition to the remote control features (screen-sharing), Timbuktu also allows for file transfers, system profiling, voice and text chat, and remote activity notifications. Timbuktu versions 5.1 and earlier initiate connections over UDP port 407, though versions 5.2 and later use TCP port 407. The program has integrated support for Secure Shell (ssh) tunneling for those who require additional security. Both the Mac and Windows versions can use a standalone user database or integrate with the respective platform's ""standard"" user database (OpenDirectory on the Mac, and Active Directory or NT Users on Windows). The 8.6 version, released in March of 2006, added an optional integration with Skype to enable a user to remote-control any of their Skype contacts who have Timbuktu installed. The 8.6 Mac version is also a Universal Binary supporting both Intel and PowerPC-based Macs.

Several software products, systems, and devices are able to create or display Flash content, including Adobe Flash Player, which is available for most common web browsers, some mobile phones and other electronic devices (using Flash Lite). The Adobe Flash Professional multimedia authoring program is used to create content for the Adobe Engagement Platform, such as web applications, games and movies, and content for mobile phones and other embedded devices.

Files in the SWF format, traditionally called ""ShockWave Flash"" movies, ""Flash movies"" or ""Flash games"", usually have a .swf file extension and may be an object of a web page, strictly ""played"" in a standalone Flash Player, or incorporated into a Projector, a self-executing Flash movie (with the .exe extension in Microsoft Windows). Flash Video (FLV) files have a .flv file extension and are either used from within .swf files or played through a flv aware player, such as VLC, or QuickTime and Windows Media Player with external codecs added.",4,,general-internet,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes

ICAP is generally used in proxy servers to integrate with third party products like antivirus software, malicious content scanners and URL filters.

ICAP in its most basic form is a ""lightweight"" HTTP based remote procedure call protocol. In other words, ICAP allows its clients to pass HTTP based (HTML) messages (Content) to ICAP servers for adaptation. Adaptation refers to performing the particular value added service (content manipulation) for the associated client request/response.

ICAP concentrates on leveraging edge-based devices (proxies and caches) to help deliver value-added services. At the core of this process is a cache that will proxy all client transactions and will process them through ICAP Web servers. These ICAP servers are focused on a specific function, for example, ad insertion, virus scanning, content translation, language translation, or content filtering.

management,non-managed,N/A (known-user),ms-scom,Non-sanctioned,"The product began as a network management system called SeNTry ELM, which was developed by the British company Serverware Group plc. In June 1998 the intellectual property rights were bought by Mission Critical Software, inc,[1] who renamed the product Enterprise Event Manager. Mission Critical Software merged with NetIQ in early 2000, and sold the rights to the product to Microsoft in October 2000. System Center Operations Manager 2007 was designed from a fresh code base, and although sharing similarities to Microsoft Operations Manager, is not an upgrade from the previous versions.

The basic idea is to place a piece of software, an agent, on the computer to be monitored. The agent watches several sources on that computer, including the Windows Event Log, for specific events or alerts generated by the applications executing on the monitored computer. Upon alert occurrence and detection, the agent forwards the alert to a central SCOM server. This SCOM server application maintains a database that includes a history of alerts. The SCOM server applies filtering rules to alerts as they arrive; a rule can trigger some notification to a human, such as an e-mail or a pager message, generate a network support ticket, or trigger some other workflow intended to correct the cause of the alert in an appropriate manner.

SCOM uses the term management pack to refer to a set of filtering rules specific to some monitored application. While Microsoft and other software vendors make management packages available for their products, SCOM also provides for authoring custom management packs. While an administrator role is needed to install agents, configure monitored computers and create management packs, rights to simply view the list of recent alerts can be given to any valid user account.
Several SCOM servers can be aggregated together to monitor multiple networks across logical Windows domain and physical network boundaries. Through a connector framework scheme employing a web service, individual SCOM servers can exchange alerts with other network management applications.",1,,business-systems,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes

As a result, the client is able to display the artist name, CD title, track list and some additional information. 

The database is used primarily by media players and CD ripper software.

The need for CDDB is a direct consequence of the original design of the CD, which was conceived as an evolution of the gramophone record, and did not consider the audio tracks as data files to be identified and indexed. The audio CD format does not include the disc name or track names, so a supplemental database is needed to supply this information when discs are used with modern media systems. A later development called CD-Text is another solution to the same problem.

This leverages the bandwidth of the participating Coral nodes as proxy servers, so it is similar to a distributed web proxy.

To access a website through the Coral cache (and thus reduce the load on the site and use the Coral network instead), one simply has to add .nyud.net to the hostname in the site's URL. So, for example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page becomes http://en.wikipedia.org.nyud.net/wiki/Main_Page. The latter is known as a coralized link.

Using the Platform, Facebook launched several new applications, including Gifts, allowing users to send virtual gifts to each other, Marketplace, allowing users to post free classified ads, Events, giving users a method of informing their friends about upcoming events, and Video, letting users share homemade videos with one another.

Users can send and receive tweets via the Twitter website, Short Message Service (SMS) or external applications. While the service itself costs nothing to use, accessing it through SMS may incur phone service provider fees. The 140 character limit on message length was initially set for compatibility with SMS messaging, and has brought to the web the kind of shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages. The 140 character limit has also spurred the usage of URL shortening services such as tinyurl, bit.ly and tr.im, and content hosting services, such as Twitpic and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters. Since its creation in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Twitter has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It is sometimes described as the ""SMS of the Internet"" since the use of Twitter's application programming interface for sending and receiving short text messages by other applications often eclipses the direct use of Twitter.
